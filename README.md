# bookmarkdown
It is just an ordinary bookmark storage (currently in development, it is my pet project, so ;p). More info below.

## Features that I will implement in the future:
* Making the whole thing work, OF COURSE!
* More things on each item
* A more stylized polish on the page

## Why it is  not finished?
Mostly because I'm a LVL 1 Web Developer... oh wait, I can't even call myself a web developer yet. ;p

This is mostly a test of what I've learned during my self-learning process especially in JavaScript so development is going to be painstakingly slow.
